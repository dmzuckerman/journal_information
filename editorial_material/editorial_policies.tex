\section{Policies on Submissions to LiveCoMS}

\subsection{Policy on Licensing}

LiveCoMS does not ask for or request any copyright transfer.

However, in order to submit to LiveCoMS, authors must provide, at
minimum, a license for LiveCoMS to publish the article and distributed
it free of charge. We recommend that the authors release the article
under an open source license such as \href{Creative Commons
  Attribution}{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/},
releasing the document for anyone to copy and redistribute the
material in any medium or format, and remix, transform, and build upon
the material for any purpose, even commercially.  Making it available
to all of course makes it possible for LiveCoMS to publish it, and for
the community to edit and contribute.

Other more restrictive licenses may be possible as long as LiveCoMS
has the permission to publish and excerpt from the document; this
might be required if someone other than the authors has some rights to
the material (for example, if it was previously published in some
other journal). Generally, we only allow a more restrictive license in
these cases, but are happy to discuss. Please ask the managing editors
if you require some other licensing regime.

\subsection{Policies on Author Order}
Authors should, to the extent possible, determine the author order among themselves. 

\subsection{Policy on Abandoned Documents}

All submitters agree by submission of the document to so that if
authors die or abandon an article that the community wants to
continue, they have already given consent for us to come up with a way
to continue it.  In most cases, this will be addressed explicitly by
the license that the document is submitted to LiveCoMS. Generally, it
will be submitted under a license like \href{Creative Commons
  Attribution}{https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/}, in which
case it is clear that anyone can reuse and ``resurrect'' the document.

However, as a case of professional and academic courtesy, authors
should At the same time, there are still issues of ``academic
courtesy''. For this reason, if the document has not been updated by
one of the authors, and they do not respond, submission to LiveCoMS
means that the authors agree that the other others may continue. If no
authors are contactable, then LiveCoMS may accept an article based on
a previous LiveCoMS article as long as the previous authors are
recognized. 

\section{Policies About the Editorial Boards}

\subsection{Policies on Decisions}
Issues regarding governance structure, editorial board membership, leadership, and financial
model must be decided by a 2/3 majority vote of the editorial
board.

Other issues, such as editorial policy, licensing policy, can be
decided by a majority vote.

Votes will be are tallied based on the fraction of the editorial board
responding within one week written notice via e-mail. In exceptional
circumstances advance notice may be given of a rush decision, where
the board may be given one week (or more) notice that their votes will
be needed within a shorter window, such as a 12 hour window.
