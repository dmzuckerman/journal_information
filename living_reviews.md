# Living Reviews

Perpetual reviews, like standard reviews, except that they can be
updated as information comes out, and can be responsive to community
input, and remain up to date on the current state of the field as it
evolves. An example of this process can be found at in [Mobley at
al. review](https://github.com/MobleyLab/benchmarksets), which was
originally an "Annual Reviews in Biophysics" article, but is now being
updated regularly.

## Review Criteria

* Do the authors properly include information from the recent literature, such as from the last 6 to 12 months?
* Have the authors removed data that is out of date, and qualified information that has been disproven?
* Do the authors include data and viewpoints that are contradictory to their own?
