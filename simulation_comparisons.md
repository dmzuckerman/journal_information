**Comparisons of molecular simulation programs**: 

Simulation comparison papers describe attempts to perform the same
calculation with a range of different simulation programs.  Such
comparison should be updated periodically with different versions of
the same programs (or potentially additional programs).

**Review Criteria**

* Does the paper include developers or advanced users of all programs being compared to ensure that comparisons are fair? 
* Are best practices being used in the simulation comparisons?
