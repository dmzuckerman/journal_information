# Tutorials

Tutorials are articles that come accompanied by web pages with walkthroughs and downloadable files to work with. These take users through specific tasks or sequences of tasks to help them learn how to do these tasks on their own for other applications or purposes. Tutorials should endeavor to not just cover the specific task at hand, but also highlight how the steps might need to be modified (or additional care might need to be taken at particular points) to handle more general cases. Tutorials for specific software packages must provide instructions and files for the current version of the software.  The submission of existing tutorials, so long as they meet journal standards, is explicitly welcomed, to encourage the highest quality tutorials by providing some degree of academic credit for these important and time-consuming efforts.

## Review Criteria

* Are files to run the simulations posted online in a permanent (or nearly so) way.
* Are the tutorials helpful and educational?
* Do they include enough information on how to generalize the approach to handle other cases, and highlight major issues to consider?
