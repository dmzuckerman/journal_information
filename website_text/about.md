The Living Journal of Computational Molecular Science (LiveCoMS) provides a peer-reviewed home for manuscripts which share best practices in molecular modeling and simulation. 
These works are living documents, regularly updated with community input, and can include living or perpetual reviews, tutorials, comparisons between software packages, and other documents which aim to improve the studies in the field and require ongoing updates.

LiveCoMS is an overlay journal, in that it does not host its own articles. 
Rather, it highlights and "publishes" preprints, specifically, linking to, providing peer reviews of, and increasing visibility of permanently archived documents which are posted elsewhere.
