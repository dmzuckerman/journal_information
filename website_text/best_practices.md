# Best Practice Guides

The inspiration for Best Practices documents can be found in the Atul
Gawande article [The
Checklist](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/10/the-checklist),
later expanded in his bestseller [The Checklist
Manifesto](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/). The
main goal of these documents is to reduce common errors by ensuring
appropriate choices are made throughout a difficult task. 

For our purposes, simulation checklists should help users avoid the
most common reasons for failure or incorrect results. Checklists will
typically also be accompanied by an explanation with sources, so the
rest of the document can go into more detail on best practices and
cover more possible failure modes and how to avoid them. One can
divide the types of errors that are made performing molecular
simulations into (a) mistakes experienced researchers often make, (b)
mistakes new users often make, even after having received solid
training in fundamentals of molecular simulation. Most checklists will
be focused on these types of failures.  A third type (c), would
involve preventing mistakes of naive users who do not understand the
basic principles of molecular simulation. These will usually require
special documents aimed at novice users which serve as prerequisites
for more detailed documents.

**Review Criteria**

* Would following the checklists help users avoid significant potential errors in simulation? Will the errors be profound and/or frequent? 
* Are all assertions well sourced in published data (which may, in some cases, include data created for the document)?
* Are the explanations clear enough for researchers with only moderate training in simulation?
