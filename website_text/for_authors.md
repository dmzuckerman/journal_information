Thank you for your interest in LiveCoMS. 
The Living Journal of Computational Molecular Science is a peer-reviewed journal and welcomes submissions from all investigators. 

# Before Submission

Authors should first send a presubmission letter to an editor in the relevant area. 
The contents of the  letter are described in the [Guide for writing articles for LiveCoMS](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/).
**Submissions without an approved presubmission letter will be rejected without review, and authors will not receive any refund on their submission.**

Once approved for submission, the authors should prepare the manuscript using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) in a suitable public [GitHub](http://wwww.github.com) repository, using our [LaTeX template](https://github.com/livecomsjournal/article_templates). 
Instructions on how to use the templates can be found [in the GitHub repository with the template files](http://https://github.com/livecomsjournal/article_templates).

A complete description of the submission process can be found in [the guide for writing an article for LiveCoMS](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/).

# Review and revision

Once submitted to LiveCoMS, review proceeds much as any other journal; however, review criteria are slightly different. 
A key purpose of the articles is that they should be useful to a range of researchers, but especially early-stage researchers. 
Thus, all articles will be reviewed by a member of the student review board, which consists of graduate students and postdocs invited by the editorial board. 

A unique aspect of LiveCoMS is article versioning. 
New versions of manuscripts can be submitted for peer review, to be treated as new publications, with new DOIâ€™s. 
Authors are therefore encouraged to involve the community in reviewing, improving, and (if warranted) expanding their work, with comments and responses done via the GitHub issue tracker. 
Such review and revision can occur at any time--before submission, during the review process, and after acceptance. 
When the author feels the article is sufficiently different from a previously published LiveCoMS article, they can submit a new version for publication. 
A description of the versioning process can be found in [the guide for writing an article for LiveCoMS](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/).  

We understand that in the evolving lifetime of such a perpetual article, there may be changes in authorship. 
Our principle is that participants (e.g. new authors, people providing feedback) should receive credit for their contributions. 
A complete description of LiveCoMS policies for publication credit can be found in [the guide for writing an article for LiveCoMS](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/). 

# Types of articles
 
Four types of manuscripts are currently published in LiveCoMS: Best practices guides, perpetual reviews, comparisons of molecular simulation programs, and tutorials. 
More details on each of these article types can be found in [our authors guide](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/).

# Article restrictions

Articles do not need to contain original research, but may do so. 

There are no explicit length limits on any manuscript, but authors are reminded that excessive length discourages readership.  In cases where the authors find a lengthy article is required, careful organization with descriptive sectioning is highly recommended.
