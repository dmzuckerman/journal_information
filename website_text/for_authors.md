Thank you for your interest in LiveCoMS. The Living Journal of
Computational Molecular Science is a peer-reviewed journal and
welcomes submissions from all investigators.

# Before Submission

Authors should first send a presubmission letter to an editor in the
relevant area.  The contents of the [letter are described here]. The
authors should prepare the document using
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) in a public repository owned
by one of the authors on [GitHub](http://wwww.github.com), using the
[template LaTex files to start
from](http://www.github.com/livecoms/author_templates). Instructions
on how to use the templates can be found [in the GitHub repository with
the template files](http://www.github.com/livecoms/author_templates).

The authors the post the resulting document to a preprint server of
their choice. Posting to the preprint server can be done at any time
before review. After posting to the preprint server, the authors then
submit to LiveCoMS.  A complete description of the submission process
can be found in [the guide for writing an article for LiveCoMS](https://github.com/livecomsjournal/journal_information/manuscript_process.md)

# Review and revision

Once submitted to LiveCoMS, review proceeds much as any other journal,
with editors assigning reviewers. A key purpose of the articles is
that they should be useful to a range of researchers, but especially
beginning researchers.  Thus, all articles will be reviewed by a
member of the student review board, which consists of graduate
students and postdocs invited by the editorial board.

A unique aspect of LiveCoMS is article versioning. New versions of
manuscripts can be submitted for peer review, to be treated as new
publications, with new DOIâ€™s. Authors are therefore encouraged to have
other researchers review their content, with comments and responses
done via the GitHub issue tracker. Such review and revision can occur
at any time--before submission, after acceptance. When the author
feels the article is sufficiently different.  A description of the
versioning process can be found in [the guide for writing an article
for LiveCoMS](https://github.com/livecomsjournal/journal_information/manuscript_process.md).  

We understand that in the evolving lifetime of such a perpetual
article, there may be changes in authorship.  A general principle of
LiveCoMS LiveCoMS is that participants (new authors, people providing
feedback) should recieve credit for their contributions. A complete
description of LiveCoMS policies for publication credit can be found
in [the guide for writing an article for LiveCoMS](https://github.com/livecomsjournal/journal_information/manuscript_process.md)).

# Types of articles

There are no explicit length limits on any manuscript. Articles do not
need to contain original research, but may contain it.  Four types of
manuscripts are published in LiveCoMS: Best practices guides,
perpetual reviews, comparisons of molecular simulation programs, and
tutorials. More details on each of these articles can be found 
in [the guide for writing an article for LiveCoMS](https://github.com/livecomsjournal/journal_information/manuscript_process.md)
