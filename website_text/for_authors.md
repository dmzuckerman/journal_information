Thank you for your interest in LiveCoMS. The Living Journal of Computational Molecular Science is a peer-reviewed journal and welcomes submissions from all investigators.

# Before Submission

## Presubmission letter

Authors should first send a presubmission letter to an editor in the relevant area.  The letter should be no more than one page, and should:
* Outline the scope of their best practice document or review.
* Explain how the proposed manuscript is different than existing best practices articles or reviews. 
* Note whether it is adapted from a previous article (and identify the article if so).
* Explain the expertise that the proposed authors have on the subject.
* Describe the license that the authors will use that will enable the article to be released freely to the public.

Potential authors submitting a presubmission letter will typically receive an answer within two weeks with either encouragement for a full submission, suggestion to work with previous authors on existing articles, or discouragement.
Articles should be received within six months of a notification of encouragement.

## Preparation of Preprint Document

The authors should prepare the document using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) in a public repository owned by one of the authors on [GitHub](http://wwww.github.com).  For an example, see [the following perpetual review](https://github.com/MobleyLab/benchmarksets). Questions, comments, or additions from the community would be filed as issues and then could be incorporated. LiveCoMS [provides template LaTex files to start from](http://www.github.com/livecoms/author_templates), and instructions for exactly how to structure the documents.

The authors post the resulting PDF document to a preprint server of their choice, which can be any one of:
* [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org)
* [BioRxiv](http://www.bioarxiv.org)
* [ChemRxiv](https://chemrxiv.org/)
* [Faculty of 1000 Research](https://f1000research.com)
* Any of the [Open Science Framework preprint servers](https://osf.io/preprints/) (engrXiv, etc.)

Posting to the preprint server can be done at any time before review. 

# Types of articles

There are no explicit length limits on any manuscript. Articles do not need to contain original research, but may contain it.

**Best Practices Manuscripts**: The goal of best practices manuscripts are to improve the quality of simulation research by providing advice that can eliminate the most common errors. 
These documents consist of:

A. A succinct list of steps that people should follow when carrying out the task in question. This is effectively a “checklist”, provided to ensure certain basic standards are followed and common but 
critical major errors are avoided.

B. A much more detailed section with the necessary rationale for the checklist, which would act as more complete “best practices” description, with significant detail as to the possible alternative ways to accomplish a given task, when one would be better than another, and significant literature documentation about reasons for choices.

**Perpetual Reviews**: These are like standard reviews, except that they can be updated as information comes out, and can be responsive to community input, and remain up to date on the current state of the field as it evolves. 

# Review process

After posting to the preprint server, the author will upload the final PDF files (which have been created using the [LiveCoMS templates](http://www.github.com/livecoms/author_templates) for consistent formatting) and a link to the GitHub site of the articles.

The authors will submit a cover letter with suggestions for 4-5 reviewers.

The editors will choose reviewers, which may include the editors themselves. Typically, at least one reviewer chosen by the student editorial board will be included, to help ensure accessibility.

Reviews will generally be anonymous, though reviewers will be allowed to become known if they desire.

Authors are also encouraged to have other researchers review their content, with comments and responses done via the GitHub issue tracker.  A history of revisions in response to community issues will favorably help the review.

Reviews will consider the following factors, depending on manuscript category:

* Best practice documents
    * Would following the checklists help users avoid significant potential errors in simulation? Will the errors be profound and/or frequent? 
    * Are all assertions well sourced in published data (which may, in some cases, include data created for the document)?
    * Are the explanations clear enough for researchers with only moderate training in simulation?
* Perpetual reviews
    * Do the authors properly include information from the recent literature, including last 6 to 12 months?
    * Have the authors removed data that is out of date, and qualified information that has been disproven?
    * Do the authors include data and viewpoints that are contradictory to their own?

**Manuscript Revisions Process**: If manuscript revision is requested, authors will be asked to re-submit within 14 days for minor revisions and 30 days for major revisions. After this time, a revised manuscript will be handled as a new submission.

## Versioning

A unique aspect of LiveCoMS is article versions. New versions of manuscripts can be submitted for peer review, to be treated as new publications, with new DOI’s.  Versioning should generally be done no more frequently than every 12 months.  

The review process for a revision to be listed as a new version of the document will be similar to the review process for the initial version.  Additional review criteria will include whether or not issues the community raised were responded to, and whether the revision includes sufficiently new material. 

* Best practice documents may start with more frequent versions, as initial rounds of community input are solicited. Authors are encouraged to update their private GitHub versions as frequently as desired; 

* Perpetual Reviews: Authors will be asked to update reviews at least once every 36 months for reviews, and will be encouraged to change authors as needed so the review can be maintained, or else the review will be “made emeritus” and indicated as out of date on the site.  We recommend updating at least every 24 months.  However, Authors decide when it is time to re-version based on feedback. 

Participants (authors, people providing feedback and filing issues, etc.) should get credit for their contributions. 
* People who offer comments/citations are listed on  the relevant GitHub README markdown file, and should be listed in the acknowledgement section if contributions are used in the paper.  
* If the current authors feel that the contributions rise to the level of authorship, they can add new authors when the next major version is submitted.   
* In general, changes which constitute writing a significant part of the article merit authorship, but not those which do not. Smaller changes should be acknowledged. 
* Exactly what constitutes “significant” is by necessity subjective, and authors should endeavor to be generous. 
* Editors will also review revisions to ensure appropriate credit is being given.
* If contributors feel that they should be given authorship based on the number of accepted commits, the editors will help resolve any disputes.  
* If contributors feel that their commits are not being accepted by the authors they should first strive to convince the authors and the community that are reviewing the document through better documented and more convincing arguments.  
* If authors do not engage with substantial issues that have been raised, they may be asked to address these in the review process. 
* If authors do not substantively engage in the discussions on issues that are raised, this may prevent new updates of the review from being accepted.

# Funding Compliance:
Authors are required to report funding sources and grant/award numbers relevant to the manuscript for ALL authors.

Authors should note whether any funding could be perceived as a conflict of interest - e.g., an article describing software in which an author has a financial interest.

# Licensing and Rights: 

## Licensing 

LiveCoMS does not require any copyright transfer to the journal.  Instead, LiveCoMS requires some license that allows LiveCoMS to distribute the articles freely consistent with Open Access requirements. We recommend that all submissions to LiveCoMS be released by the author under a Creative Commons By Attribution license version 4.0  All rights are retained by the authors. 

## Policy on Prior Publication: 

Documents should not have been submitted in the current form to another journal, or be simultaneously under consideration for publication another journal. Preprints (previous to the one submitted to LiveCoMS) do not count as prior publication.  Documents that are major revisions of previously published articles are welcomed. However, authors should ensure that material they develop for the journal does not have rights reserved by other journals from such previous publication that impede release under open licenses. Some journals, for example, “Annual Reviews” let the authors retain rights for derivative works, which could be exercised in preparing a review to be published in LiveCoMS. 

If an article is an adaptation of a previously published article, it must be noted in the cover letter, and major changes noted. Evaluating whether such changes constitute a significant revision will be part of the review process.
