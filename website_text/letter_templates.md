## Sample decision letters


### Minor revisions

Following is a sample decision letter which might be used for communicating the outcome of the review process to the authors.

Dear Dr. `{{AUTHOR-LAST-NAME}}`,

Thank you very much for your submission of your article, `{{MANUSCRIPT-TITLE}}`, to the Living Journal of Computational Molecular Sciences (LiveCOMS).
We are delighted to inform you that we anticipate being able to accept your article, pending satisfactory completion of minor revisions as recommended by the reviewers (and detailed below).
To facilitate the re-review of your manuscript, please submit a PDF version with *highlighted* changes, such as via [latexdiff](https://www.sharelatex.com/blog/2013/02/16/using-latexdiff-for-marking-changes-to-tex-documents.html).
A final unhighlighted, publication-ready version will be requested should your manuscript be accepted.
As you make the recommended changes, we also encourage you to make a final check that:
- The article is well edited and all images and tables are of high quality and well laid out
- Your final submitted PDF is in fact how you want your article to appear in its final version, as the journal does not typeset or alter the formatting of your article
- Your GitHub repository is in order and ready to accept feedback from readers

Thank you again for joining with us in this exciting new publishing enterprise!

Sincerely,
`{{SENDER-FULL-NAME}}`
