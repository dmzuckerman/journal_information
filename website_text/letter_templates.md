## Reviewer letters

### Sample review request letter

Dear Dr. {{AUTHOR-LAST-NAME},  (Change from Dr. if going to a grad student)

I would like to invite you to review an article entitled "{{MANUSCRIPT-TITLE}}", which has been submitted to the Living Journal of Computational Molecular Science (LiveCOMS). The abstract of the article is included below.

LiveCoMS is a new and unique journal, which focuses on promoting best practices in molecular computation via updateable educational articles of various kinds - tutorials, reviews, best practices descriptions, comparisons of computational programs, and “lessons learned” about molecular simulation. The journal is low-cost, non-profit and run by members of our community in a transparent way; in part, it aims to provide academic credit for important work that often goes unrewarded. We encourage you to learn more about the journal at the journal web site as well as learn more about the unique aspects of the review process for LiveCOMS.

Reviews are due in 15 days. If you feel you are unable to review this article, we would appreciate suggestions of other reviewers. 

LiveCOMS has a Conflicts of Interest policy and reviewers should make sure they are familiar with this and decline to review if they have a conflict, or if they are uncertain, to disclose any potential conflicts to the editor managing the review process.

If you have any other questions about the reviewing process, please respond to this email, or feel free to reach out to the editors at managing@livecomsjournal.org.

Thank you very much,
{{SENDER-FULL-NAME}}
Editor, Living Journal of Computational Molecular Science

## Sample decision letters


### Minor revisions

Following is a sample decision letter which might be used for communicating the outcome of the review process to the authors.

Dear Dr. `{{AUTHOR-LAST-NAME}}`,

Thank you very much for your submission of your article, `{{MANUSCRIPT-TITLE}}`, to the Living Journal of Computational Molecular Sciences (LiveCOMS).
We are delighted to inform you that we anticipate being able to accept your article, pending satisfactory completion of minor revisions as recommended by the reviewers (and detailed below).
To facilitate the re-review of your manuscript, please submit a PDF version with *highlighted* changes, such as via [latexdiff](https://www.sharelatex.com/blog/2013/02/16/using-latexdiff-for-marking-changes-to-tex-documents.html).
A final unhighlighted, publication-ready version will be requested should your manuscript be accepted.
As you make the recommended changes, we also encourage you to make a final check that:
- The article is well edited and all images and tables are of high quality and well laid out
- Your final submitted PDF is in fact how you want your article to appear in its final version, as the journal does not typeset or alter the formatting of your article
- Your GitHub repository is in order and ready to accept feedback from readers

Thank you again for joining with us in this exciting new publishing enterprise!

Sincerely,
`{{SENDER-FULL-NAME}}`
